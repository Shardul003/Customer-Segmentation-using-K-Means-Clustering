# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
<h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
This project demonstrates how to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The segmentation helps identify different customer groups, which can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies.
<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics. This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on features like income and spending patterns.

<h3><u>Dataset</u></h3>
Source: Provided the dataset used in the project (from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository).
<h3><u>Usage</u></h3>
You can run the notebook kmeans.ipynb to execute the customer segmentation analysis. The notebook includes:
<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing and exploration</li>
  <li>Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm</li>
  <li>Visualizing the clusters</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Results:</u></h3>
The project produces visualizations such as:
<ul>
  <li><b>Elbow Method Plot: </b>To determine the optimal number of clusters.</li>
  <li><b>Customer Segments: </b>Scatter plots showing the segmented customer groups along with the cluster centroids.</li></ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This project successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their income and spending patterns using the K-Means clustering algorithm. These segments can be leveraged to devise targeted marketing strategies.
